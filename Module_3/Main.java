/*
An int data field titled with your first name.
A constructor that takes and sets the initial value.
Getter and setter methods.
Non-Static methods titled isEven(), isOdd(), and isPrime() returning true or false based on the variableâ€™s value.
Static methods with signatures isEven(int), isOdd(int), and isPrime(int) with the same basic logic as the previous methods with results based on the parameter.
Static methods with signatures isEven( Integer), isOdd( Integer), and isPrime( Integer) with the same basic logic as the previous methods with results based on the parameter.
The methods equals(int) and equals( Integer) which returns true if int values are equal and false if they are not.
Write test code that creates three instances, two with the same value, and one with a different value.
Write test code that ensures all methods function correctly.
